### Power Off Mode During Idle
Enable to shut down power during extended idle times.

### Minimum Idle Mode Duration (sec)
Minimum idle time required before switching off.

### Diagnostic LED Brightness (%)
Set brightness level for onboard diagnostic LEDs.

### Max Operating Temperature (C)
Maximum temperature allowed before the robot halts operation.

### Minimum Storage (GB)
