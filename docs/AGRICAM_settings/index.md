# AGRICAM Settings

The **Settings** tab of the AGRICAM GUI, built with NiceGUI, enables users to configure and customise the behaviour of the autonomous monitoring system. It is divided into three main sections:

- **Track Stations**: Define the physical layout of the track, specify stop locations, and configure monitoring zones.
- **Monitoring Schedule**: Set time-based routines, data capture preferences, and automation behaviour.
- **Advanced Settings**: Configure hardware constraints and operational safety parameters.

Use the links below to navigate to each section:
