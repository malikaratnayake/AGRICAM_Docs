# AGRICAM LED Status Indicators

The AGRICAM robot uses two panels of three RGB LEDs each to provide a simple, visual summary of its operational state. These LEDs are grouped as follows:

- [AGRICAM LED Status Indicators](#agricam-led-status-indicators)
  - [Panel 1: System and Movement Status](#panel-1-system-and-movement-status)
  - [Panel 2: Recording and Scheduling](#panel-2-recording-and-scheduling)
  - [Notes](#notes)

Each LED uses distinct colours to convey information clearly and intuitively.

## Notes
- Each panel corresponds to a dedicated RGB LED module on the robot.
- Colours are chosen for quick field-level interpretation.
- LEDs update automatically to reflect the robotâ€™s real-time status.

This indicator system helps users understand AGRICAM's operation at a glance without needing additional displays or interfaces.
