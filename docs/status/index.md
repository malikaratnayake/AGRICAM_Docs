# AGRICAM Status

The **Status** tab in the AGRICAM GUI provides a real-time view of the robot's current state, operations, and navigation history. It is divided into two main subsections:

- [📊 Overview](status_overview.md)
- [🗺️ Map](status_map.md)
- [💡 LED Indicators](led_indicators.md)

These sections help operators monitor system performance and station visits during a monitoring cycle.
