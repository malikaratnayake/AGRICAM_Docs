# üó∫Ô∏è Map

The **Map** section visualises the robot‚Äôs visit history across all defined stations.

### Station Indicators

Each stopping station is shown in a vertical layout with the following indicators:

- **Station Icon**: A colour-coded circle next to each station shows its current status:
  - White: Not visited
  - Green: Robot is currently at the station and stopped
  - Red: Robot has just departed the station

### Time Labels
- **Arrived**: Displays the timestamp of when the robot last arrived at a given station.
- **Departed**: Displays the timestamp of the last departure.

These visual cues allow users to monitor where the robot has been and verify that data was captured at the appropriate stations.

The map view updates continuously in sync with the robot‚Äôs movements and provides clear context for live operations.
